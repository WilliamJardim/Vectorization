## Inspiration
The concepts implemented in this library were inspired by various sources, including:
- Images and diagrams found on Google Images about matrix multiplication and vector operations.
- Personal understanding of linear algebra concepts acquired through academic studies and previous experiences.

## Implementation
The implementations were done independently, based on the understanding of mathematical concepts.
